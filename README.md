## Student portfolio from COP4813: Internet Programming

This repository is from a previous class I took the summer semester of 2017.  The course objectives included:

- Students will use current technologies to develop Internet and web-based applications. The topics to be covered include:
  - Client and server-side components for the WWW to facilitate client-server communication 
  - Web services 
  - An introduction to Internet security. 
  
For this class we utilized HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, JQuery, and AJAX to complete assignments.

### Note: The server-side assignment (5-7) are non-functional on github pages.
