<h3 style="text-align:center">ePortfolio</h3>
<p class="index">Welcome to my ePortfolio.  My name is Stephen Hartman, currently a junior in the Bachelor of Science Computer Information Systems program at the University of North Florida.  This first assignment involves familiarizing myself with the tools and presentation-tier architecture to be used in my web application.<br/><br/>
It has been pretty much a refresh of previous experience so far.  I learned about HTML and CSS using <a target="_blank" title="W3Schools" style="color:white" href="http://www.w3schools.com">w3schools.com</a> for another course, and I use SSH to manage my home web server and media server which uses debian. 
Overall I would say that I truly enjoy web design.  My internship this summer involves maintaining and implementing new features to an existing Ruby on Rails application, therefore I will benefit from this course and the internship in similar fashions.
<br /><br />Now that I have finished this assignment, I can confidently say that I can create a simple webpage using CSS and HTML.  The assignment requirements stated we could use either a table or CSS to format, but tables are pretty outdated when it comes to web design.  CSS3 is more powerful and versatile than ever before, and I look forward to finding new and creative ways of utilizing markup languages.

<h3 style="text-align:center">HTML Form with Javascript</h3>
<p class="index">For this assignment I am tasked with creating a form using HTML tags and Javascript functions.  The requirements include textboxes, buttons, check boxes, dropdown menus, a reset button, and a submit button which are alldriven by a Javascript program to compute the user submitted information in a meaningful way.<br/><br/>
I have little to no experience with Javascript and web forms, but if this task is any like previous assignments with new technologies and methods, it should a good experience.  I enjoy learning new techniques and syntax because I truly feel invested in this field.  Some may see this assignment as something they just need to pass a course, but I kind of like being given deadlines and goals when learning a new subject.<br/><br/>
This project proved to be a bit of a challenge.  I am particular with web design, so getting things just right takes a good bit of time.  I also learned more about how the context of the attributes in HTML are more important in terms of Javascript and JQuery.  Either way I feel good about my work and what I have learned through this process.<br/><br/>
</section>
<section>
<h3 style="text-align:center">Learning Objectives:</h3>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>Make an HTML web form which collects information using text boxes, radio buttons, check boxes and dropdown lists.  Give the users options to reset the form or submit with validation.
</li>
<li>Create a Javascript program to validate appropriate information, process the information if the data is valid and display an error otherwise, use conditionals and switch structures to implement the information, and present results on the screen
</li>
<li>Create a flow chart which represents the decision structure.</li>

<h3 style="text-align:center">Repitition Control Stuctures with Arrays</h3>
<p class="index">This assignment I treated similarly to the last one, with only one exception being the inclusion of a javascript library.  I tried to crack into JQuery, but with this accelerated semester and my internship, I feel like I fell short of that suggested route.<br/><br/>
This being a programming course, I felt that this assignment is closer to the type of programming I have grown comfortable with, namely writing code designed to calculate or carry out a specific task.  Markup presents a challenge as well, but with this assignment I felt that writing the javascript library felt more natural compared to designing web page elements.  I have grown fond of creating web pages over the years, but testing certain elements to my specifications has become tedious due to my perfectionism, for better or for worse.<br/><br/>
I mirrored the design of my form from assignment two, because as one of my favorite professors said over and over, programmers are lazy.  That is the beauty of style sheets and external libraries though, you can make a template similar to a rubber stamp and just copy and paste until the job is done.  Cohesive design has become easier than ever, and I intend to take advantage of that.  Now if I could only find the time...<br/><br/>
</section>
<section>
<h3 style="text-align:center">Learning Objectives:</h3>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>Make a javascript library which can carry out specific functions using control patterns.  Create functions which can be used by other functions within the library for modular design.
</li>
<li>Create a form which the user can input a set of numbers for the external library to manipulate.  Round all results to two decimal places and present the information in a meaningful and easy to read manner.
</li>
<li>Use three sets of data for unit testing and data validation.</li>

<h3 style="text-align:center">HTML Canvas: Concept Animation</h3>
<p class="index">This assignment took me longer than the others due to the fact that I had to create an animation.  I lack creativity when it comes to choosing how to represent things visually, but I finally settled on creating a sine wave animation.  The math was easy enough and HTML Canvas was fun to learn.  Using functions in order to draw lines seemed like a challenge, but I just had to figure out where I wanted the lines on the coordinate plane and code accordingly.<br/><br/>
I liked this assignment because I had to think outside the box in order to complete it.  Brushing off the dust from my trigonometry skills was good, but I would rather create a web design rather than design physical objects.  I know that physics is required to program games or any sort of animation in a 2D or 3D space, and this is pretty much the first time I tackled a problem like that.<br/><br/>
</section>
<section>
<h3 style="text-align:center">Learning Objectives:</h3>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>Create an animation of a concept which includes a higher level concept.  This requires knowledge of the HTML Canvas and programming on a 2 dimensional plane.
</li>
<li>Communicate a message through the animation which includes textual and graphical information through colors, text, shapes, and motion of the elements.
</li>
<li>Include sound in the animation to connect to the visual effect.</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="text-align:center">PHP Stock Portfolio Manager</h3>
<p class="index">Once again I spent lots of time on this project.  Gradually I am recognizing the value of learning the fundamentals of web technology.  Being a rails developer I see much of these functions from a high level, automated perspective, so this course is definitely paying off for my learning experience.<br/><br/>
I've never done any sort of server-side scripting before, so this was definitely a new experience.  It took me quite a while to finish, and I wasn't able to represent the data exactly how I wanted, but I'm sure once I dive into databases that problem will take care of itself.  Session variables are valuable for many reasons, and I liked how URLs can be manipulated by the get method in order to redirect a certain way.<br/><br/>

<h3 style="text-align:center">MySQL Database</h3>
<p class="index">Somehow I knew my diligence would pay off, and it came in the form of the ease of designing this assignment.  I already had the HTML, CSS, PHP, and Javascript laid out before me in my previous assignments, so all I had to create was a database and use CRUD functions to manipulate the data.<br/><br/>
That being said, it was easy up to a point.  One requirement of this assignment was to address SQL injection and prevent malicious queries in my forms.  At first I implemented a normal SQL database with no data validation.  The difficult part came in determining how to address SQL injection.  There are two ways to access the database, either PDO or MySQLi, the former being compatible with many relational databases and the latter being compatible with MySQL databases.  I chose MySQLi because of the requirements and the fact it was a bit easier to use knowing MySQL.<br/><br/>
Armed with MySQLi, I was able to create queries using parameters in order to validate data.  This involved building query strings in which you could pass in arguments, and those arguments would be bound to strings or integers using bind_param() and prepare().  After all the data was in the query, I used execute() on the query in order to query the database.  Overall it was a good learning experience, I ran into a few issues in how to properly display data and pass along the proper queries, but in hindsight it was very straightforward compared to non-prepared statements.
</section>
<section>
<h3 style="text-align:center">Learning Objectives:</h3>
<div class="ul">
<ul>
<li>Create a database using MySQL, with one table used to store up to ten fields (columns).</li>
<li>Create forms using specific inputs and Javascript in order to create, modify, or delete records in the database.</li>
<li>Address SQL injection by applying the proper techniques in the SQL queries and PHP.</li>

<h3 style="text-align:center">AJAX Basics</h3>
<p class="index">
This assignment was easy just as the instructor pointed out.  Each assignment has built on my knowledge from the previous, and armed with the proper techniques this took no time at all.  I created a form with a select dropdown which utilized an external javascript file containing an AJAX call to filter the MYSQL data using PHP.  That's a mouthful.<br/><br/>
Putting it together was a bit tricky because previously I had included the php to display data on my main page.  Sourcing that externally in order to call the database dynamically solved my issues with this assignment.  Overall I have learned quite a bit from this course, and I plan to use that knowledge in the years to come.  Thanks for visiting!
