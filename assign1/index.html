<h3 style="margin-left:15%">Here is a bit of my story and my current contact information:</h3>   
<p>I have lived in North Florida for most of my life, and I feel like it is the perfect place to live.  Maybe I'm biased, but growing up here has had a huge impact on how I see the environment and the world at large.  I attended college briefly after high school, but I couldn't find my niche in the university system.  Slowly over my adult life, I have realized that not only does technology fascinate me and bring new ideas to the world, but it drives the economy in ways I never dreamed of.<br/><br/>
I currently live with my wife Ariel and our two-year-old son Louis in northwest St. Johns county with our dog Duder.  I'm glad to be a part of this community and contribute to the future of the field through my work.  This past spring I participated in the Regency Centers IT Practicum, which was not only rewarding from an educational standpoint, but professionally as well.  I learned the many processes and collaborations which occur within the IT departments and across other business units.  Information work no longer depends on pure technology, you have to adapt and learn the business in order to succeed in this field.</font><br/><br/>
The future holds many possibilities for me and my family.  Beginning this summer, I will be interning with a legal software company called <a style="text-decoration:none; color:white" target="_blank" href="http://www.groundswell.online">Groundswell</a> which has a huge potential of value and growth.  I look forward to learning and collaborating everyday, and I am excited that you, the reader, are participating with me.</p>
